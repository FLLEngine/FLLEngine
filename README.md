# Introduction

This library aims to be an all-in-one pybricks-micropython library designed for FIRST Lego League. Our focuses are:

- ease of use
- precision
- reliability

We would love to add features such as:

- higher acuracy gyro sensor reads
- easily-integrated failsafes
- positional tracking based on motor and gyro reads as well as color sensor reads (maybe)
- an easy-to-use graphical interface 
- multiple pathfinding algorithms
- reverse kinemetics for attachments
