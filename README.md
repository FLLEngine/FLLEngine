what it needs to be:

    -a clone of the original colin_gyro.ev3
    -if possible a more accurate gyro funtion


what it CAN be:

    -an API for getting the robots position at any given time
    -an automatic line following API (given a path from an A* algorithm)
    -an intuitive interface with the API for generating paths
    -awesomeness


# ToDo


priority:

    -make an intermediary API between micropython and the rest of the code (for compatibilty updates later on)
    -recreate the ToLoc fuction
    -recreate the ToLoc_angle_brain function
    -recreate the turn function
    -recreate the straight_final function
    -recreate the format_converter function
    -recreate the routes

non-priority (in order of importance):
    -improve gyro accuracy
    -A* incorporation
    -beautify
