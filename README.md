# Introduction

This library aims to be an all-in-one pybricks-micropython library designed for FIRST Lego League. Our focuses are:

- ease of use
- precision
- reliability

We would love to add features such as:

- higher acuracy gyro sensor reads
- easily-integrated failsafes
- positional tracking based on motor and gyro reads
- an easy-to-use graphical interface that might even be 3D ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
- multiple pathfinding algorithms
- reverse kinemetics for attachments

# ToDo


priority:

    -make an intermediary API between micropython and the rest of the code (for compatibilty updates later on)
    -recreate the ToLoc fuction
    -recreate the ToLoc_angle_brain function
    -recreate the turn function
    -recreate the straight_final function
    -recreate the format_converter function
    -recreate the routes

non-priority (in order of importance):

    -improve gyro accuracy
    -A* incorporation
    -beautify
